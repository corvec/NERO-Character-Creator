NERO Character Creator
	by Corey T Kump

This is a desktop NERO character creator and tracker for Windows (or Linux).
It's designed to make it easy to figure out what you want to do with your character (build-wise, at least).

It is written in Ruby. It uses Qt 4.6 for the GUI and YAML files for all data.

It has the following features:
 * Tracks basic information, such as player name, character name, race, class, and primary school of magic
 * Allows you to easily and quickly "build" your character
 * Save and load your characters so that you don't have to rebuild them every time
 * Keeps track of your experience so that you can better determine how to spend your build
 * Tracks formal effects upon the spirit
 * Saves your character's back story
 * Makes it especially easy to determine your spell tree
 * Tracks deaths and spirit forges

		<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			NERO Character Creator (NCC) is a tool designed to help NERO players plan out the development of their characters.
			It can also be used by plot members to store NPC stats and by Chapter owners to store backups of their players' characters. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2 id="basic">Basic Use</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			The NERO Character Creator user interface consists of four main tabs: the Info tab, the Build tab, the Experience tab, and the Backstory tab.
			</p>
			<h3 id="info_tab">Info Tab</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The Info tab contains information about the character.</p>
				<p><img src="screenshots/clip0001.zoom68.png" width="662" height="445" border="0" alt="Info Tab Screenshot"></p>
				<table>
					<tr><th><strong>Player Name</strong></th><td>The name of the person that plays this character.</td>
					<tr><th><strong>Character Name</strong></th><td>The character's name.
					<tr><th><strong>Date Created</strong></th><td>The day this character was placed "on the books."</td>
					<tr><th><strong>Race</strong></th><td>Selecting your race automatically updates the costs of relevant skills.  It must be set in order to purchase racial skills.</td>
					<tr><th><strong>Subrace</strong></th><td>For example, you may be a <em>Lizard</em> Scavenger or a <em>Quentari</em> Elf.  This is completely for flavor purposes.</td>
					<tr><th><strong>Class</strong></th><td>Changing this re-calculates your spent build and current body.</td>
					<tr><th><strong>Primary and Secondary Schools</strong></th><td>Changing one automatically changes the other.</td>
					<tr><th><strong>Spirit and Body Effects</strong></th><td>Formal Magic effects on your spirit and Body.  If you don't know what these are, you probably don't have any.</td>
					<tr><th><strong>Death History</strong></th><td>This automatically calculates the number of black stones you will have on your next death.</td>
				</table>
			</div>
			<h3 id="build_tab">Build Tab</h3>
			<div>
				<p>On this tab, you manage purchased skills and your spell tree.</p>
				<p><img src="screenshots/clip0002.zoom68.png" width="662" height="445" border="0" alt="Build Tab Screenshot"></p>
				<h4>Purchasing Skills</h4>
				<p>Skills can be purchased by selecting them from the drop down menu and clicking &quot;Add.&quot;</p>
				<p>Certain skills, namely Proficiency and Craftsman Other, have an option that you can choose. &nbsp;These options are written in the &quot;Note&quot; field.</p>
				<p>If the skill has multiple options (like a Proficiency) then you should separate the options with commas. &nbsp;If it doesn't, just write it out.</p>
				<h4>Building a spell tree</h4>
				<p>Your primary and secondary spell tree are defined on the Info tab, but you can update your spell tree here, if you have the prerequisites. &nbsp;This tree enforces legality, so you can just add a 9th level spell in order to build a 4/4/4/4/4/4/3/2/1 tree.</p>
				<p>If you have Enforce Build activated, the tree will revert to its previous state if it would be too expensive to build the tree in order to meet the prerequisite you requested.</p>
				<h4>Error Messages</h4>
				<p>You may encounter an error message while attempting to add a skill. &nbsp;These error messages are fairly self-explanatory.</p>
				<p><img src="screenshots/clip0003.png" width="457" height="99" border="0" alt="Insufficient Options Provided: Please provide the following options..."></p>
				<p>If you encounter the message &quot;Insufficient options provided&quot; then the program did not understand the options you entered in the way you wrote them. &nbsp;With proficiencies, note that you must spell out the word &quot;Right&quot; or &quot;Left.&quot;</p>
				<p><img src="screenshots/clip0004.png" width="506" height="113" border="0" alt="You cannot add 'Healing Arts' because you are missing some prerequisite. The prerequisites are..."></p>
				<p>If you encounter a message like this, then you're missing a skill. &nbsp;Try purchasing that skill before purchasing this one.</p>
				<p><img src="screenshots/clip0005.png" width="506" height="113" border="0" alt="You cannot add Strongarm because it does not have a cost defined for your character. It is most likely a racial ability."></p>
				<p>If you encounter this message, you are most likely attempting to add a racial skill. &nbsp;You can set your race on the Info tab.</p>
				<p><img src="screenshots/clip0006.png" width="395" height="99" border="0" alt="You cannot add Proficiency because you do not have enough loose build!"></p>
				<p>If you encounter this message, you have the &quot;Enforce Build&quot; option turned on and have attempted to purchase a skill that you cannot afford.</p>
				<p>You can disable this by turning that option off. &nbsp;Alternatively, you can increase your available build on the Experience tab.</p>
				<p><img src="screenshots/clip0007.png" width="457" height="99" border="0" alt="You cannot add 'Shield' because it is included in Style Master, which you already have."></p>
				<p>You may encounter this error if you attempt to buy Florentine, Two Weapons, or Shield when you already have Style Master, or if you try to buy a weapon skill when you already have Weapon Master.</p>
			</div>
			<h3 id="experience_tab">Experience Tab</h3>
			<div>
				<p>This tab is used to add Experience to a character.</p>
				<p><img src="screenshots/clip0008.zoom68.png" width="662" height="469" border="0" alt="Experience Tab Screenshot"></p>
				<p>The Location and Date buttons are optional - they are used solely if you want to preserve information.</p>
				<p>By default, Goblin Blankets are added individually. &nbsp;If you wish to have them added manually, set the Goblins option to &quot;Group&quot; in the configuration file.</p>
			</div>
			<h3 id="backstory_tab">Backstory Tab</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The Backstory Tab keeps track of your backstory. &nbsp;You can use it to track any relevant notes for a character.</p>
				<p><img src="screenshots/clip0009.zoom68.png" width="662" height="469" border="0" alt="Backstory Tab Screenshot"></p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2 id="saving">Saving and Loading</h2>
		<div>
			<p>NERO Character Creator saves files to your My Documents directory by default.  This behavior can be changed by modifying the "Save Directory" parameter of the initialization file, ncc.ini.</p>
			<p>Certain changes are automatically committed to a file named ncc.yml in the default save directory.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 id="advanced">Advanced Use</h2>
		<div>
			<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The initialization file (ncc.ini) contains a number of options that can be used to specialize NERO Character Creator for your own use. &nbsp;These options are case sensitive and may cause the program to crash if they are improperly set.</p>
				<p>If you cannot modify this file while it is in the Program directory, copy it and all of the data files into a folder in your personal profile. &nbsp;Then, modify the shortcut to Start In that folder. &nbsp;(Right click on the shortcut and click on Properties).</p>
				<table>
				<tr><th><strong>Log Output</strong></th><td>the full filename of the log file. &nbsp;The default is &quot;nero.log&quot; in the program's directory. &nbsp;STDOUT can be used if you want the log to be output to the command line.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Log Count</strong></th><td>the number of log files that should be saved. &nbsp;The default is 5.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Log Size</strong></th><td>the maximum size of a log file, in bytes. &nbsp;The default is 100 KB.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Log Threshold</strong></th><td>This determines how important log messages must be. &nbsp;The default is 'INFO'. &nbsp;The options are 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'FATAL'. &nbsp;Set this to 'DEBUG' if you're encountering a recurring bug to report the details.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Skill Count Min Width</strong></th><td>Default is 10. &nbsp;This controls the size of the increment and decrement buttons for listed skills on the Build page.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Skill Count Max Width</strong></th><td>Default is 20. &nbsp;This controls the size of the increment and decrement buttons for listed skills on the Build page.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Skill Count Min Height</strong></th><td>Default is 10. &nbsp;This controls the size of the increment and decrement buttons for listed skills on the Build page.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Skill Count Max Height</strong></th><td>Default is 20. &nbsp;This controls the size of the increment and decrement buttons for listed skills on the Build page.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Skill Entry</strong></th><td>Choices are 'Drop Down' or 'Text Box'. &nbsp;'Drop Down' is default and the 'Text Box' is an auto-completing text box.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Title</strong></th><td>The title of the program. &nbsp;Any text is acceptable.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Enforce Build</strong></th><td>true or false. &nbsp;If true, you cannot add skills or spells if you would then have negative loose build. &nbsp;The default is false.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Save Directory</strong></th><td>the full path of the directory where character sheets will be saved. &nbsp;The default is the My Documents folder on Windows and the Home directory on other operating systems. &nbsp;This parameter can be set to &quot;PROGRAM&quot; to instead save in the working directory, which by default is the program's directory.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Skill Data</strong></th><td>the name of the skill data file. &nbsp;The default is 'skills.yml'.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Module 1</strong></th><td>the filename of a supplemental skill data file. &nbsp;Default is none.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Module X</strong></th><td>the filename of more supplemental skill data files. &nbsp;X is a number.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Chapter</strong></th><td>the name of the chapter for these characters.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Autosave</strong></th><td>This can be set to True or to False to enable or disable auto-saving, respectively. &nbsp;The default is True.</td></tr>
				<tr><th><strong>Goblin</strong></th><td>This can be set to 'Individual' or 'Group'. &nbsp;If set to Group, the experience from a set of Goblin blankets is calculated without updating your build between them. &nbsp;The default is Individual.</td></tr>

			<h3 id="creating">Creating a Skill Module</h3>
			<div>
				<p>A skill module can be easily created by adding skills to a plain text file. &nbsp;For additional help on any of the definitions declared herein, first refer to the existing module files.</p>
				<p>Note that these skill files must follow the YAML standard - namely, this means you must use spaces instead of tabs for indentation.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example Skill</span></p>
				<p>The following is an example skill, Combat Prowess, which is a prerequisite for &quot;Physical Strike&quot; abilities.</p>
				<div style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">
					<table cellspacing="1px" cellpadding="0" border="1px black solid" style="border: 1px black solid; border-spacing:0;">
						<tr style="text-align:left;vertical-align:top;">
						<td valign="top">
							Combat Prowess:<br/>
							 &nbsp; &nbsp;Cost:<br/>
							 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fighter: 4<br/>
							 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scholar: 8<br/>
							 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rogue: 6<br/>
							 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Templar: 6<br/>
							 &nbsp; &nbsp;Requires:<br/>
							 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Weapon<br/>
						</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</div>
				<p>This skill can only be purchased once. &nbsp;Its costs are defined for each class. &nbsp;It requires a weapon skill. &nbsp;That's all you need!</p>
				<h4>Stacking Skills</h4>
				<p>If we wanted to create per-day skills based off of this skill, we could do that as follows:</p>
				<div style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">
					<table cellspacing="1px" cellpadding="0" border="1px black solid" style="border: 1px black solid; border-spacing:0;">
						<tr style="text-align:left;vertical-align:top;">
							<td valign="top">
								Physical Strike Disarm:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp;Cost:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fighter: 2<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scholar: 4<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rogue: 3<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Templar: 3<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp;Requires:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Combat Prowess<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp;Max: 0<br/>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</div>
				<p>This skill can be purchased any number of times, as long as you have the skill Combat Prowess. &nbsp;If you wanted to cap the purchase at some other number, you could do so by setting Max to that number.</p>
				<h4>Advanced Requirements</h4>
				<p>Suppose you wanted a skill, Physical Strike Shatter. &nbsp;To purchase this, you have to have at least one Physical Strike Disarm per purchase.</p>
				<div style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">
					<table cellspacing="1px" cellpadding="0" border="1px black solid" style="border: 1px black solid; border-spacing:0;">
						<tr style="text-align:left;vertical-align:top;">
							<td valign="top">
								Physical Strike Shatter:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp;Cost:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fighter: 3<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scholar: 6<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rogue: 4<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Templar: 4<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp;Requires:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Physical Strike Disarm: 1<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp;Max: 0<br/>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</div>
				<p>If you wanted to require 2 Physical Strike Shatters per purchase, you would change the 1 to a 2.</p>
				<p>Note that pyramided skills are not yet supported. &nbsp;If you desire this functionality, please contact the program author.</p>
				<h4>Racial Skills</h4>
				<p>It's easy to create skills that can only be purchased by a particular race or that cannot be purchased by a particular race. &nbsp;The first sort of skill can be created by only having a cost defined for a particular race. &nbsp;The second sort can be defined by listing that race under 'Prohibits'.</p>
				<div style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">
					<table cellspacing="1px" cellpadding="0" border="1px black solid" style="border: 1px black solid; border-spacing:0;">
						<tr style="text-align:left;vertical-align:top;">
							<td valign="top">
								Barbarian Slay:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp;Cost:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Barbarian: 10<br/>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr style="text-align:left;vertical-align:top;">
							<td valign="top">
								Mining:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp;Cost:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dwarf Fighter: 2<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dwarf Scholar: 3<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dwarf Rogue: 3<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dwarf Templar: 2<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp;Max: 0<br/>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr style="text-align:left;vertical-align:top;">
							<td valign="top">
								Infusing Celestial Essence:<br/>

								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Templar: 4<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp;Prohibits:<br/>
								 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Biata<br/>

NERO Character Creator
	by Corey T Kump

This is a desktop NERO character creator and tracker for Windows (or linux).
It's designed to make it easy to figure out what you want to do with your character (build-wise, at least).

It has the following features:
 * Tracks basic information, such as player name, character name, race, class, and primary school of magic
 * Allows you to easily and quickly "build" your character
 * Save and load your characters so that you don't have to rebuild them every time
 * Keeps track of your experience so that you can better determine how to spend your build
 * Tracks formal effects upon the spirit
 * Saves your character's back story
 * Makes it especially easy to determine your spell tree
 * Tracks deaths and spirit forges

 
The NERO Character Creator is currently in Beta but is very usable.  I'm looking for any sort of relevant feedback - opinions, bugs, feature requests, and so on.  Please send any relevant feedback to Corey.Kump@gmail.com with "NERO Character Creator" in the subject line.

Known bugs:
 * Occasionally crashes on windows
 
Enjoy!

Races:
    Barbarian: >
        Barbarians come from nomadic tribes and are unused to "civilized"
        society. They are a very superstitious lot and may often perform
        unusual small ceremonies to rid themselves of their "curse."
        ("Oh-oh! Seven hoblings just crossed path! Bad luck! Now I must tie
        string around finger and walk backwards for an hour!") This is not
        to imply that barbarians have to be stupid - merely uncultured and
        somewhat primitive. In order to be identifiable as barbarians, you
        should talk poorly, dress in furs and leathers, and otherwise look
        primitive. Barbarian tribes (usually named after animals) are often
        very competitive and not too friendly.

        Barbarian tribes are very earth friendly and in fact, celestial magic
        was unheard of by barbarians until the more "civilized" beings
        began moving into their area. As such, barbarians distrust celestial
        magic and consider it "not natural." Barbarians fear and distrust
        celestial magic and will dislike having celestial protective spells cast
        upon them. This distrust only applies to Celestial Defensive spells,
        and does not apply to Celestial Magic Items. It should be noted that
        there are some characters that refuse to use Celestial Magic Items
        for role-play reasons of their own. This "Celestial Abstinence" is
        not required by the rules in any way. All players are encouraged to
        role-play their characters in any way that they consider fun.
        When a barbarian reaches the age of 18, he or she will ask the tribe
        leader for a Task of Adulthood. This task must require an extreme
        amount of bravery and challenge and may take many years to
        accomplish. Only when the task is completed will the barbarian be
        considered a true member of the tribe. Barbarians who switch tribes
        are likewise required to perform such a task.

        Barbarians are strong and thus start off with two extra body
        points. They have to pay double for all Scholarly skills. They can
        also buy the skills Barbarian Slay and Detect Celestial Magic
        which, once a day, will allow the barbarian to determine whether an
        item has any celestial magic present upon it.
    Biata:
        According to legend, biata are descended from a barbarian tribe, but
        they do not act or look like barbarians. They have large upturned
        feathery eyebrows and often grow feathers in their hair and claws
        on their fingers as well. (The claws are decorative in nature and
        cannot be used as weapons.)

        Biata tend to be very orderly in their philosophy of life - they always
        act with a purpose. They will not do things "on a whim" and are always
        working towards some goal. To other races, this tends to make them
        seem like extremists - either very good or very evil - but even the most
        evil biata will have his or her own code of ethics and will never act
        erratically or randomly. This also makes the biata seem very stubborn.
        They are also very secretive about the origins of their race and will
        treat all other races as "outsiders" rarely worthy of complete trust.
        It is said that biata were formed through magical mating of a gryphon
        and a human (or perhaps a barbarian). The Gryphon barbarian tribe was
        made up entirely of biata and until the last Great Celestial Change in 590,
        all biata looked like humans.

        Having celestial protective spells cast upon biata causes great
        discomfort. Most will refuse to sleep behind Wards and will not use
        celestial magic items. All players are encouraged to role-play their
        characters in any way that they consider fun.

        Mentalist: Biata, like stone elves, have spent years honing mental
        skills and as such can perform certain mental abilities. These abilities are
        all completely role-playing in nature. Generally speaking, a biata can
        remove role-playing insanity based on memories or otherwise "cure"
        mental damage on any willing subject. You cannot use this ability to
        tell if another player is telling the truth or to have that player remember
        events forgotten due to a FoRget elixiR or otherwise get around any
        NERO rule. A player always has the right to refuse to role-play any
        of these skills and can at any time decide to "break off" contact or be
        cured. In order to use this role-playing skill, you must touch the other
        person and concentrate completely by either staring into each other’s
        eyes or by both of you having your eyes closed. You cannot perform
        any other in game skill while role-playing this. Any biata who simply
        touches someone and says "There, you no longer have a fear of heights (or
        whatever)" is not playing the race properly. For more information about
        these skills, see "Mind Abilities" in the chapter on Special Abilities.
        Biata can buy the skills Break Charm, Resist Charm, and Resist Sleep.
        Biata cannot learn Read Magic.
    Drae:
        Drae are dark elves, a mysterious race that mostly lives
        underground, shunning sunlight. They have jet black skin, white
        or silver hair, and pointed ears. They rarely socialize with other
        races. They keep to themselves and generally feel themselves to be
        superior to all other races.

        When playing a Drae, the most important thing to remember is
        honor. The Drae culture emphasizes honor to such a degree that
        a Drae who has lost honor should commit suicide as punishment
        before honor can be regained. This does not mean that you cannot
        be an evil Drae; it merely means that you will keep your word once
        it is given. If you are disgraced in any way, you will publicly do
        what needs to be done for your honor to be restored.
        Drae can have a sense of humor but must take their own actions
        very seriously. There are Drae entertainers (though rare) but even
        these regard honor as the highest attribute.

        Drae have -2 Body Points in the daytime (defined as 6 a.m. to 6
        p.m.). At 6 a.m., the drae loses 2 points from their maximum Body
        Points (never below one Body Point), adjusting their current Body
        Points to match if necessary. This means that a Drae will never fall
        unconscious due to this penalty. At 6 p.m., the Drae’s maximum
        Body Points go up by exactly the same number of points that they
        went down the night before. This rule cannot be used to circumvent
        other effects where Body Points are lost.

        Drae can buy Resist Sleep and Resist Charm. They can also buy
        the Archery skill at half cost (round up), but they cannot use Two
        Handed Blunt weapons or Two Handed Swords.
    Dwarf:
        Dwarves are sturdy individuals who live in mountainous regions.
        Dwarves in NERO are not necessarily short (remember that all
        players and monsters are the same size as the person playing
        them), but taller players should think twice about playing a dwarf.
        In-game, the rumor is that dwarves are the small cousins of hill
        giants, and so to the giants, they were seen as short.
        Dwarves tend to be friendly but secretive. They all have beards,
        although many females prefer a long goatee. Their race enjoys and
        appreciates good craftsmanship, especially in weapons, armor, and
        jewelry. Because they live so much longer than humans, they tend
        to dislike the humans’ faster paced lifestyles (but they generally like
        the food).

        Dwarves have an extreme hatred of trolls who often attack and
        take the dwarven caves for themselves. Their history is very lengthy
        but is mostly comprised of stories and legends of great dwarven
        heroes. Some of these stories can take many hours or even days to
        tell completely, and no self-respecting dwarf would consider telling
        an abridged version.

        Dwarves are generally peaceful and have no problem with
        other races - although they think elves are pompous, humans are
        impatient, hoblings are troublemakers, and half-orcs and-half ogres
        are incapable of understanding the finer things in life (like a well
        made weapon and a fine wine).

        They start with one extra body point, can buy Resist poison,
        and can buy the Smithing skill for one point less. Dwarves cannot
        use Polearms, Staves, Two Handed Blunt Weapons or Two handed
        Swords. They must pay double for Read Magic.
    Elf:
        Elves are long-lived people with pointed ears. That may be the only
        thing all the elven races have in common!

        All elves can buy the skills Resist Sleep and Resist Charm. They
        have one less Body Point than a human character of the same class
        and level. They can buy the Archery skill at half cost (round up),
        but they cannot use Two Handed Blunt weapons or Two Handed
        Swords.

        There are many varieties of elves.
    Gypsy:
        Unlike other races that are distinguished by physical features,
        gypsies are defined by costume, behavior, and culture. To be a
        gypsy means to be boisterous, extroverted, and larger than life.
        Gypsies, a fiery and passionate race, love to dance and sing. The
        most important aspect of gypsy life is family. The gypsies have
        enormous loyalty to their people, treating each as a family member
        and referring to them as "brother" or "sister."

        Many gypsy tribes may coexist in the same area, each being ruled
        by its own Bandoleer or "Prince/Princess." There is a Gypsy King
        but quite often this figure is far removed from normal gypsy life and
        has no great influence over the local tribes. Usually a gypsy tribe
        will have its own distinctive predominate color or marking, used to
        differentiate itself from other tribes in the area.

        Gypsies can bestow or remove Gypsy Curse, the use of which is
        limited by the Gypsy Code of Honor. The Gypsy Code of Honor
        requires that a gypsy be always honest and trustworthy among
        members of his or her own tribe. The gypsy will support the other
        tribe members and will do whatever it takes to help (including lying
        to, stealing from, and cursing or killing non-tribe members).

        The Gypsy Code of Honor means respecting the actions of fellow
        gypsies as well. If a gypsy places a gypsy cuRse on someone, it had
        better be for a good reason (sometimes, the recipient might take
        action against the entire tribe). If there was a good reason, then the
        entire tribe will support that gypsy.
